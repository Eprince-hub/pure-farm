## Setup

If you would like to set up the project yourself, follow these steps:

## MongoDB Atlas

- The application requires MongoDB Atlas in order to work.
- It is necessary to create or have a [MongoDB Atlas Account](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) for that.
- Once your done with that, you need to create a new cluster if you don't have one yet.
- Stick to the instructions of the [Official Documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-new-cluster/) to do that.
- Make sure to select a shared database as it is the only one that is for free.
- After having done all of the previous steps, you should see your cluster under Deployment/Databases.
- Click on 'Browse Collections'.
- Create a new database with a name you would like.
- Once you've created the database go back to the main page under Deployment/Databases.
- Click on 'Connect' and then click on 'Connect your application'.
- Copy the connection string starting with 'mongodb+srv...'. You will need it for the next step.

## Cloning the Project

- Clone the project using git clone.
- Add your project to your GitHub Profile.
- After you're done with that, open your code editor and terminal.
- Run yarn to install all the require dependencies.

- You need to declare seven environment variables in there:

- MONGODB_URI (with the value of the connection string you copied from MongoDB Atlas).

- DB_Name (with the value of the name of the database you created within the cluster).
